<p>
My research is quite broad at the moment, in terms of anything to do with reptiles and amphibians; the main two areas I focus on are infectious diseases and population monitoring. These can be reflected in my publications and blog posts that can be found on my blog. I have been slowly moving more towards the infectious disease side of things over the past couple of years due to my growing interest in the subject. I find them completely fascinating and I hope to help find a way to mitigate the devestating effects that emerging infectious diseases such as the chytrid fungus (<i>Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</i>) and snake fungal disease (<i>Ophidiomyces ophiodiicola</i>) have on susceptible populations.

As a scientist, I enjoy going to conferences and meetings in order to hear about research other people in my field are currently undertaking. It is also a great chance to network with potential collaborators or learn about a new piece of software or a technique that can be applied to your own study.
