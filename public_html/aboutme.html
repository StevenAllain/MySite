Hello everyone, if you hadn't guessed it already my name is Steve. I'm a zoology graduate from Anglia Ruskin, Cambridge and a current Master's student at Imperial College London. My current area of research is primarily based around amphibian disease and population ecology. As as a zoology graduate I have a wide base of knowledge to draw from but it's always been amphibians and reptiles that have appealed to me. I'm often asked how I got into what I do and the answer is simple - I just never grew up. I'm always looking for new projects to get involved with and finding ways to answer the questions that spontaneously pop into my head.  
<br/>
<br/>
My passion for the natural world and conserving herpetofauna has opened a number of doors for me, some of which have seen me take on a number of responsibilities. For example, I'm the current chairman of the Cambridgeshire and Peterborough Amphibian & Reptile Group (CPARG) and I help to organise and coordinate a number of amphibian and reptile surveys around the county. I was also a blogger for The Wandering Herpetologist, a once popular herpetological blog some of you may remember me from. I also used to be an intern for IUCN SSC Amphibian Red List Authority, focusing on south-east Asian amphibians. It's easy to see where my passion lies and I hope that with the website that I'll be able to tie everything together in one place!

I'm a current member of the Amphibian Specialist Group (ASG) as well as the International Varanid Interest Group (IVIG). My use of social media extends past my personal use, I manage the Twitter accounts for The British Herpetological Society (BHS) and Captive and Field Herpetology. The BHS is a long running society that was founded in 1947 to further the science of herpetology, I'm also a member of the society's council.
