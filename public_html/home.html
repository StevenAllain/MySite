<center><h1>Welcome to the wonderful world of herpetology!</h1></center>
<p>Hey everyone! My name is Steve and I'm an eccentric and passionate herpetologist based in the UK, although my fieldwork and research has taken me all over the globe. I grew up not far from London and fell in love with the limited diversity of British herpetofauna as a small boy. Growing up, I would always be outside chasing frogs or trying to photograph lizards, which helped to plant the seeds for my future career. As I grew older, I started to persue this fascination more through my academic studies and now I'm currently a PhD candidate at the University of Kent. You can find out more about my story on the 'About Me' page which is both a fun insight into my life as well as a comprehensive list of my affiliations and achievements.</br>

My view is that the impoverished herpetofauna of the British Isles are a greatly undervalued group of animals, that when understood can bring enjoyment to anyone, especially those that love the outdoors and nature. I hope that with this website I'll be able to help enthuse you about their conservation as well as inform you about my personal journey through academia and share stories about the projects I've been involved with.</br></br>

Below you can find quick links to some of the more important pages on my website. I intend to post more content regularly on my blog, so keep an eye out for that too. Just click on the images to be taken to the relevant pages.</br>
